# A Cocktail database site 

## This is a project that uses React as the frontend and a fake database on heroku created with json-server deployed on Heroku. React-Router V5 does the client side Routing. 

## The coktails are fetched from the Cocktails-db API here ["https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php']

## When the page loads a user will see a list of cocktails and its details and an option for 'My-cocktails', when a cocktail is clicked the user will see its details and shall be able to add that cocktail to their database. 

## The post and delete methods will make requests to the database on heroku.

## The styling on the project is done with Tailwind css ["https://tailwindcss.com/"]
